# Smart Proxy Ansible Director

Smart Proxy Ansible Director is the Smart Proxy pendant to [foreman_ansible_director](https://github.com/ATIX-AG/foreman_ansible_director).

This plugin handles:
* building of execution environments via `ansible-builder`
* execution of Ansible jobs via `ansible-navigator`
* execution of Ansible remote-execution jobs

Therefore, `ansible-builder` and `ansible-navigator` are dependencies.
As of 2026-02-01, these have to be installed manually.


Please refer to the [main repo](https://github.com/ATIX-AG/foreman_ansible_director/blob/main/README.md) for information on:
* The current state of the project
* Development guidelines
* installation instructions
